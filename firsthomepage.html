    <H1>Hi, I'm Aisling!</H1>
    <P>Some of my friends call me Trash or Ash. I am an outgoing, loud, and energetic person and love to interact with people. I am 17 years old. I go to San Rafael High School and I am a senior. I really like candy and I LOVE snowcones. I do not like the dark or spiders. Some of friends are Mia, Platt, and Jackson. We spend a lot of time together.</P>
    <H2> Fun facts about me</H2>
    <P> A fun fact about me is I have never had Peanut Butter! Many people try to force me to eat it. They will hold me down and force it in my mouth or sneak it in different foods that I am eating. However, they have never been successful. Also, I play three sports. In the fall, I play tennis. In the winter, I play soccer and in the fall, I play lacrosse. In my sophomore year, I went on a service trip to Ecuador with a group of students from SRHS. We went to Bahia de Caraquez. My friend Mia came with me. We had a great time and we saw a new country, while learning Spanish and helping the community. </P>
    <H2>My goals for this year</H2>
    <P> This year my main goal is to pass AP Calculus BC. It will be very challenging, but I will try my hardest. I do not like math. I want to continue getting good grades in school and finish applying to college.I also want to have a fun and successful soccer and lacrosse season. Also, I want to learn a lot more about computer science and coding. </P>
