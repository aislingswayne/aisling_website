    <p>I was born in Greenbrae, California at Marin General Hospital. My mom, Freda, and my father, Brian, had my older sister, Sinead, in 2000. Two years later, I was born on April 3, 2002. Both of my parents are Irish, so as a child, I would go to Ireland every summer to visit my extended family. </p>
    <p>My older sister is now 19 years old. She goes to CalPoly in San Louis Obisbo. She is majoring in Biology.</p>

    </div>
    <p>I have lived in Sun Valley, San Rafael my entire life. I went to Sun Valley Elementary school. Then, I went to Davidson and now San Rafael High School. As a kid, I played a lot of sports. I played soccer, softball, basketball, swim. In high school, I have played soccer, lacrosse, and tennis. I live on a small cul de sac that is filled with kids. Everyday when I was a child, I would go outside and play different activities with the neighborhood kids.</p>
