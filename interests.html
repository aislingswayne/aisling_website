      When I was very young, I learned how to swim. I swam almost everyday, and eventually joined a swim team when I was 5. I swam for a team called Tidlewaves. I was on this team until I entered high school. I began playing soccer when I was 4 years old. I played for a San Rafael Recreational Team. I continued playing for them, until I was 9 and moved on to a club team called Central Marin. I played on this team until I was 14 and then I began playing for Marin Football Club. I have played for them team until now. It is all year round and causes me to travel around the state for games. In high school, I have played varsity soccer every year. I helped start the girls lacrosse team at San Rafael and have played for two years now. Also, I joined the varsity tennis team this year! I really enjoy playing sports and I have played for my entire life. They make me extremely happy and have caused me to meet some of my best friends. I enjoy the the sense of community and friendships that are made when being on a team. Sports are a really big commitment, but they are worth it.</p></div>
